	From Place Bellecour, the three main roads of the Presqu'île de Lyon, the Terreaux district to the north and the Perrache district to the south start, including two pedestrian streets:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>rue de la République, which leads to the Place de la Comédie between the Town Hall and the Opera House
        <li>then onto Place Louis-Pradel via Rue du Puits-Gaillot on the north side
        <li>rue Victor-Hugo, leading to Perrache on the south side</a>.</center>

    <center><p>On the north side, the rue du Président Édouard Herriot, where the cars pass and where the luxury brands are concentrated, leads to the Place des Terreaux.<br>
    <br>
    The square is also located on the east-west axis linking the right bank of the Rhône and the right bank of the Saône.<br>
    The Vieux Lyon district and Saint-Jean cathedral are to the west, on the other side of the Bonaparte bridge over the Saône, which can be reached via Rue du Colonel-Chambonnet.

    <center><strong><h1>Odonymy</h1></strong></center>
    <center><p>
    In Gallo-Roman times, Bellecour was an island or peninsula formed by alluvial land.<br>
    The district knows at the time a Roman activity, military and commercial: one finds there Cannabe,<br>
    barracks 6 serving as warehouses for Gallo-Roman merchants and sailors, the city was then located <br>
    on the Fourvière hill and descended on the Saône river at the third level.<br>
    At the end of the 12th century, the archbishop of Lyon owned Bella Curtis on the peninsula, which consisted of vineyard land. Abandoned, the place became marshy again.<br> 
    In 1562, the Baron des Adrets attacked Lyon, setting up his armed men on what was then "le pré de Belle-court"<br> 
    .In 1604, Henry IV urged the town council to acquire the meadow to create a public square.<br>
     But in a never-ending trial, the archbishop's heirs clashed.<br>
     In 1708, Louis XIV took definitive possession of the site. The Place Louis Legrand is adorned with bronze statues of the king by Martin Desjardins.<br>
    The square is surrounded by buildings whose facades were designed by the king's first architect Robert de Corte. In 1658, Louis XIV visited Lyon only once in his youth.<br>
    Since his installation in Versailles, the king has been present in the provinces, notably through his equestrian statues.<br>
    During the Revolution, an altar of liberty was erected there on 14 July 1790. A guillotine was installed there in 1792. The royal statue was destroyed in 1793.<br>
    On 21 June 1800, Bonaparte passed through Lyon after his victory at Marengo and laid the first stone of the new building.<br>
    During the restoration, the square was adorned with a new statue of Louis XIV, inaugurated on 6 November 1825, by the sculptor François-Frédéric Lemot.<br>
    In 1829, Lady Girard established the famous buvette on the square.<br>
    The two pavilions on the square were built by Tony Desjardins in 1852.<br>
    To the west, near the kindergarten, before becoming the offices of the tourist office "Le Rectangle",<br>
     is an exhibition hall called Maison de Lyon.<br>
